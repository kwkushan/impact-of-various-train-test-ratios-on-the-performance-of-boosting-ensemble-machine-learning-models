Codes in this repository was developed as a part of a research done on "Impact of Various Train-Test Ratios on the Performance of Boosting Ensemble Learning Models in Formation Porosity Prediction Using Well Log Data". Three boosting models; adaptive boosting (AdaBR), gradient boosting (GBR) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBR) were developed.
